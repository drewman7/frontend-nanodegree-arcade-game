Hello, welcome to the Drewman Frogger Game!

*** Start the Game!
Starting the game is simple.  Just load the webpage.  The game can be found at the following link:
http://drewman7.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/


*** The Goal!
The goal of the game is very simple.  Get to the water!  See?  It's that easy!

Well, it's of course not that easy...you have to avoid running into the bugs or letting the bugs touch you.

*** The Controls!
The controls are easy.  Move your avatar using the arrow keys on your keyboard.  You can move up, down, right, and left.

You can also use the space bar.  The space bar changes your avatar.

*** Your Avatar!
If you don't want to use the avatar you have on the screen, simply press the space bar and your avatar will change.  There are six avatars available.  Just keep pressing the space bar till you find the one you want.

*** Directions?
If you forgot how to play, you'll be provided with directions at the bottom of the game board when you are in the starting square (which is the center square at the bottom of the game board).  The directions disappear when you move off the starting square, but reappear when you step back on the starting square.

*** Score and Encouragement
Every time you make it to the water, you will receive a point.  You'll also see a 'Good Job!' appear to improve your self-esteem.  

However, when you get hit by a bug, your score will go down by one.  Yes, your score can go negative.  You'll receive an encouraging message to try again, because we know you can make it!
